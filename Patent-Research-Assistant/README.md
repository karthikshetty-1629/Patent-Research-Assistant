# Patent-Research-Assistant
RAG x LLM
Patent Research Assistant
Overview
The Patent Research Assistant is a comprehensive full-stack application that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to make patent research more accessible and efficient. The system combines advanced Natural Language Processing techniques, domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), and a scalable vector database to enable efficient retrieval, analysis, and contextual understanding of patent data.
Features

Natural language patent search interface
Voice recognition for queries
Dark/light theme support
Responsive design
User authentication system
Advanced patent data retrieval using RAG
Vector-based similarity search
Real-time patent analysis

Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Backend: Python, AWS Lambda
Database: AWS OpenSearch
AI/ML:

PatentSBERTa for embeddings
Falcon 7B for text generation
RAG implementation using LangChain


Cloud Services:

AWS S3 for static hosting
AWS Lambda for serverless computing
AWS API Gateway
AWS OpenSearch for vector search
AWS CloudWatch for monitoring

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

AWS Account with appropriate permissions
Python 3.8 or higher
Node.js and npm (for development)
AWS CLI configured

Frontend Setup

Clone the repository
Navigate to the frontend directory
Configure the API endpoint in app.js
Deploy to S3:

bashCopyaws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name
Backend Setup

Create a new Lambda function
Install dependencies:

bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt

Configure environment variables:

CopyOPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT=your-opensearch-endpoint
REGION=your-aws-region

Deploy the Lambda function
Set up API Gateway integration

OpenSearch Setup

Create an OpenSearch domain
Configure index mappings for vector search
Set up IAM roles and security policies

Usage

Access the application through the S3 static website URL
Create an account or login
Use the search bar to input patent-related queries
View patent results with relevance scoring
Toggle between voice and text input as needed

Data Processing Pipeline
The system processes patent data through several stages:

XML file splitting
Utility patent extraction
Data transformation to parquet format
Vector embedding generation
OpenSearch indexing

Monitoring and Maintenance

Monitor application performance via CloudWatch
Check Lambda execution logs for errors
Review OpenSearch metrics for query performance
Update embeddings periodically with new patent data

Security Considerations

Implement proper authentication and authorization
Use HTTPS for all API communications
Follow AWS security best practices
Regularly update dependencies
Monitor for unusual access patterns
